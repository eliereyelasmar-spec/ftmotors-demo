### urauto.ai - Detailed Analysis

**What They Claim:** AI-built web applications

**What They Actually Are:** A general-purpose no-code app builder

| Factor | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| **Founded** | March 2025 (9 months old) |
| **Location** | Australia |
| **Founder** | Yavuz Uragun (solo, hiring co-founder) |
| **Automotive Customers** | Zero |
| **Dealership Case Studies** | None |
| **Voice AI Capability** | None |
| **Industry Expertise** | None |

**The "auto" in their name is coincidental** - it refers to "automated," not "automotive."

**Talking Point for Your Friend:**
> "urauto.ai is actually a general no-code app builder from Australia that just launched 4 months ago. They have zero dealership customers, zero automotive expertise, and no Voice AI capability. The 'auto' in their name is misleading - it has nothing to do with automotive. We have a production system running right now that you can call and experience."
