## The Pitch (20-30 minutes)

### Opening Hook (2 min)

> "Ali, I called Fast Track Motors last Sunday at 8 PM. No answer. What if that was a customer ready to put $2,000 down on a car?"

*Pause. Let it sink in.*

> "Your competitor CARROMUNDO is 0.2 miles away with a 4.9 rating. When you miss a call, where do you think that customer goes?"

---

### The Problem (5 min)

**Pull up the stats:**

> "Let me show you some numbers that might surprise you."

| Statistic | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| 78% of customers | Buy from the FIRST dealer to respond |
| 21x less likely | To sell if you wait 30 minutes |
| $120 average | Value of each missed call |
| 40% of week | You're closed (Sundays + after 7 PM) |

> "You have 2,104 Google reviews - that's incredible. 4.7 stars. You've earned trust. But every missed call is a customer who might go somewhere else."

**Do the math with them:**

> "If you're missing just 25 calls per week... that's 100 potential customers per month. At a 12% conversion rate, that's 12 sales. At $2,500 profit per car... that's $30,000 a month walking out the door."

---

### The Solution (5 min)

**Show the demo landing page:**

> "Here's what we built specifically for Fast Track Motors."

Walk through the features:

1. **24/7 AI Voice Receptionist**
   > "This answers every call in 2 seconds. Books test drives. Schedules service. Handles credit questions. Even speaks Spanish."

2. **Smart Lead Capture**
   > "Beautiful forms that convert visitors into appointments. Every submission texts your team instantly."

3. **CRM Pipeline**
   > "See every deal from first contact to keys in hand. Know exactly where your money is."

4. **Automated Follow-Ups**
   > "No lead goes cold. Reminders, nurture sequences, review requests - all automatic."

---

### Live Demo - The Wow Moment (5 min)

**If Voice AI is live:**

> "Don't take my word for it. Call this number right now."

*Hand them the phone with the demo number.*

*Let them experience the AI answering as Fast Track Motors.*

> "That just answered in 2 seconds. It can book test drives, schedule service, answer credit questions, and text your team instantly - 24/7. Even on Sundays at midnight."

**If Voice AI isn't live yet:**

> "Let me play you a sample conversation..."

*Show transcript from landing page or play recording.*

---

### Show the Dashboard (3 min)

**Open dashboard-preview.html:**

> "This is what your business looks like with our system."

Point out:
- 847 calls handled by AI this month
- 312 new leads captured
- 67 test drives scheduled
- $487K in pipeline value
- Real-time activity feed

> "Imagine seeing this every morning. Knowing exactly where every lead is. No more guessing."

---

### ROI Calculator (3 min)

**Open roi-calculator.html:**

> "Let's do the math for YOUR business specifically."

*Adjust the sliders together:*
- "How many calls do you think you're missing per week?"
- "What's your average profit per sale?"
- "What percentage of leads typically convert?"

*Show the results:*

> "So for a $1,000 monthly investment, you're looking at $30,000+ in recovered revenue. That's a 30x return."

---

### Handle Objections

**"We're talking to another company" (urauto.ai):**

> "I want to make sure you're comparing apples to apples. urauto.ai is actually a general no-code app builder from Australia - they started 4 months ago, have zero dealership customers, and no automotive experience. The 'auto' in their name is misleading. We have a production system running right now that you just experienced."

**"That seems expensive":**

> "Let me flip that around. You're losing an estimated $30,000 per month in missed opportunities. Our system costs $1,000. The question isn't whether you can afford it - it's whether you can afford NOT to have it."

**"We need to think about it":**

> "Totally understand. But while you're thinking, your competitors are capturing leads. How about a 60-day pilot? If you don't see at least 10% more appointments in 60 days, you don't pay for the first month."

**"Can your AI really handle our customers?":**

> "You just experienced it. Did it feel robotic? The AI understands subprime financing questions, trade-in inquiries, service scheduling - everything your team handles. And if someone insists on a human, it transfers seamlessly."

---

### The Close (3 min)

> "Ali, you've built something special here. 2,100 reviews don't lie. But right now, 40% of the week, you're invisible. Your phones are silent while customers are shopping online."

> "We can have this live in 2 weeks. Your AI will answer the first call on day one. Every missed opportunity becomes a booked appointment."

> "Let's do a 60-day pilot. If it doesn't work, you've lost one month's fee. If it does work - and it will - you've gained a competitive advantage that your neighbors don't have."

**Hand them the questionnaire:**

> "All I need is 15 quick answers and we can start this week."
