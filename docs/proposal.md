# Fast Track Motors
## AI-Powered Sales & Service Platform Proposal

**Prepared for:** Ali Kassab, Owner
**Prepared by:** Revion Consulting
**Date:** December 2025

## Executive Summary

Fast Track Motors has built an exceptional reputation over 9 years, earning 4.7 stars from over 2,100 Google reviews. Your commitment to helping customers regardless of credit situation has made you a trusted name in Paterson.

However, you're leaving money on the table.

**The Problem:** You're closed 40% of the week (Sundays + after 7 PM). Every missed call during these hours represents a potential customer walking to your competitor 0.2 miles away.

**The Solution:** An AI-powered system that:
- Answers every call instantly, 24/7/365
- Books test drives and service appointments automatically
- Captures leads when your team is busy or off
- Follows up automatically so no lead goes cold
- Integrates with your CRM for complete visibility

**The Bottom Line:** For a fraction of what you'd pay a BDC agent, you get enterprise-level capability that never sleeps, never calls in sick, and never misses a call.

| Location | Australia | North America |
| Automotive expertise | Zero | Deep |
| Dealership customers | Zero | Active |
| Case studies | None | Available |
